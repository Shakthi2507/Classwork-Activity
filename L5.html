                        <h2>Facts about Dogs</h2>
                        <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the
                        domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
                        hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 20,000 years ago and before the
                        development of agriculture.[4] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a
                        starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.
                        
                        Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in
                        shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house
                        around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior
                        sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding,
                        pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p>

                        <P>Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies
                        and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by urinating on
                        them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human
                        behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond
                        has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best
                        friend".
                        
                        The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the most
                        popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed countries make up approximately 20% of the
                        global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of
                        feral and community dogs.</P>
